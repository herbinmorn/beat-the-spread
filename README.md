# Beat The Spread Football Gambling Game - UW Coding Bootcamp Project 3
## App Purpose
Compete with friends by predicting which NFL teams will meet the point spread, or beat the point spread. Use real NFL point spreads in this fake "gambling" game.

## What Technologies Our Appp will Implement
1. Sequelize
2. React
3. NPM Passport
4. Google Maps (to display which cities point spread competitors are in)

## Team Roles
1. Sharry - any and all backend that isnâ€™t covered by someone else (using Sequelize)
2. Sarah - React
3. Matt - user management (like Passport for logging in or maybe Google)
4. Suzanne - sports API and wireframes

## Mini-presentation (Deliverable 1)
1. Sharry - show 1 user choosing for or against 1 game's point spread using Sequelize for the backend
2. Sarah - use React and Axios to call data to the front-end showing user choosing for or against 1 game's spread
3. Matt - using NPM Passport to login at least one user
4. Suzanne - getting the homepage wireframes and internal page wireframes working and ready, including HTML builds of the homepage and internal pages

## Final Presentation (Deliverable 2)
1. Sharry - showing multiple users to bet for or against multiple games' point  spreads using the backend (Sequelize)
2. Sarah - showing multiple users to bet for or against multiple games' point  spreads using the front-end (React)
3. Matt - using Passport to log in multiple users
4. Suzanne - add the sports API to show predicted point spreads
